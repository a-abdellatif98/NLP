              "Oh what a great novel this is.  Clancy weaves a tale that is believable and complex, seemingly having thought of every detail.  We get to see a character that is thoroughly engaging, despite the fact that the book touches on such a touchy subject as condoning murder.  As reprehensible as it sounds Clancy is able to make you agree with him.The book could at times get pretty graphic but I don't think it is gratuitous.  Instead, the detail allows you to feel and see what is happening, as well as let you into Clark's world.I have nothing bad to say about this book, only good.  I would definitely recommend Without Remorse to everyone.5 stars.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           1\n",
              "Winds of War is the fictional account of the family Henry and their adventures from 1938 through Pearl Harbor. Captain Pug Henry, a career Naval Officer is sent to Germany to serve as Naval Attache in Berlin. There he meets all the big players, Hitler, Goering et al. He predicts the Stalin-Hitler non-agression pact and gets called to the White House. There Roosevelt gives him an informal assignment that keeps him involved in myriad interesting developments leading up to the invasion of Poland, then France, the Battle of Britain, and the invasion of Russia. Meanwhile, his son Brian, in Italy working for a Jewish author falls in love with the beautiful Jewish-American niece who was engaged to an American diplomat, who happens to be serving in Warsaw ... naturally Brian and Natalie are visiting her old friend Slote in Warsaw when the Germans attack. Meanwhile ... well you get the point.A popular miniseries was made of this book and its sequel, War and Remembrance.This book is VERY historically accurate. All the events are true, and one of the Henrys or their acquaintances are involved in one or more of them. This is a great read. Brilliantly told, we work through the great events through the experiences of the characters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1\n",
              "\"Say not, 'I have found the truth,' but rather, 'I have found a truth.'\"--Kahlil GibranAs you read, Gibran's poetry brings spiritual and visual beauty to life within you.  Gibran is justly famous for rich metaphors that brilliantly highlight the pursuit of Truth and Goodness amidst all the darkness and light of human nature.This is a book to read alone or with a partner, to give and receive, to go back to again and again.Note: the excerpts available in Amazon's \"Search This Book\" facility unfortunately do not do \"The Prophet\" justice, since only the book's introduction is included, whereas the wisdom does not begin unfolding until a bit later.  Therefore I've taken the liberty of including here another excerpt which more properly demonstrates the gentle power of Gibran's writing.---And a woman who held a babe against her bosom said, \"Speak to us of Children.\"And he said:Your children are not your children.They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself.They come through you but not from you,And though they are with you, yet they belong not to you.You may give them your love but not your thoughts.For they have their own thoughts.You may house their bodies but not their souls,For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you.For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth.The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and He bends you with His might that His arrows may go swift and far.Let your bending in the archer's hand be for gladness;For even as He loves the arrow that flies, so He loves also the bow that is stable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 1\n",

              "Water For Elephants tells the story of one man's life with the circus as the backdrop to all of his experiences.Jacob is a student studying to become a veterinarian when his parents are killed in an accident and he is left with no family, no money  and he walks away from that life.  He ends up picking up some work with a traveling circus and his life takes a turn that he never anticipated.  He becomes a part of the circus family (as dysfunctional as can be..........but they put the fun in dysFUNctional!)Jacob recalls his life, while he is over 90 years old and relegated to a nursing home. A nurse mentions that the circus is in town and everyone will have the opportunity to attend a show. As he sits at a dinner table with several other elderly folks, one man looking to gain attention from the women makes the claim that he \"..used to carry the water for the elephants.\"  Jacob calls him a liar, because Jacob knows the amount of water that an elephant consumes, and those vast quantities could not be carried by one man.  When a nurse asks if Jacob worked in a circus he does not answer her, and that is when his memories are brought to life.  As he waits for his outing, the days pass and he relives the last 70+ years of his life in his mind.  The stories that are told about how the circus works, the value that is placed on the money coming in, the care or lack there of, for the animals, the living conditions on the trains for the circus workers...........all these things and more come alive in Jacob's tale.While it seems that the story starts a bit hesitantly, soon the reader is caught up in the tale, what happens to the different people, the relationship between the \"stars\" and the workers, many aspects of a traveling circus are revealed, even in the treatment of the animals!This story is an interesting portrayal of life in a traveling circus, and the ending is an unexpected one that takes you unaware.This is Sara Gruen's first novel and she is nominated for two Quill writing awards.    1\n",

How could I ever overlook the single greatest fictional character that was ever wrote about.And this is from an avid Sherlock Holmes fan.George Macdonald Fraser does not get anywhere near the credit he deserves as a writer because he was not \"politically correct\".What he was though was a GREAT story teller who also could write.You may or may not like Flashy as a person but you will have to say he was a great character and maybe the luckiest man who ever lived.If you want action and adventure,ride with Flashy! Any aspiring authors would be well advised to read GMF's Flashman's series to see how a story should be told and how to write a good book.Some of this trash I see that authors try to pass off as a novel are laughable compared to GMF.There are many pretenders out there but unfortunately there are few George Macdonald Fraser's.May he RIP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   1\n",

(One hand squeezing her arse and t\\'other fondling one of her poonts) Reading any of the books in this series will buff up your knowledge of late 19th century history.','I saw the preview for the movie and decided I would like to read it  before I watched and I must say the book was better!! Gruen  grasps  your  attention from the first page til the very end of it.. I would definitely recommend reading the book i enjoyed it thoroughly and  will definitely  be looking  for more  by Gruen!','Another fantastic, mind-gripping read, holding its audience from page one. Bloodline spins the tale of a family-run pharmaceutical conglomerate.  Roffe and Sons has been passed down to the heirs of Samuel Roffe\\'s family, Sam Roffe, the only male descendant and holder of the controlling interest of the company, Anna Roffe married to Walther Gassner, Ivo Palazzi, married to Simonetta Roffe, Charles Martel married to Helene Roffe and Sir Alec Nichols\\' mother had been a Roffe. Samuel Roffe, founder of the company, had decided from the beginning that his company never go public.  His theory, \"Never let a friendly fox into your hen house.  One day he\\'s going to get hungry.\"  When Sam Roffe (an experienced climber) dies in a mysterious mountain climbing accident, Elizabeth inherits his controlling interest in the company.  Suddenly, life-threatening events begin to happen to her as she holds onto her great-great grandfather\\'s wishes after finding a book telling the story of Samuel Roffe\\'s life and the tense, emotional and physical struggle he endured to build the company from the ground up.  In her great-great grandfather\\'s memory and approach, she is determined to keep the company private and uncover the person responsible for the evil doings within the upper echelon (that being one of four of her cousins) or possibly her father\\'s right-hand man, Rhys Williams.  Rhys, not being a member of the family, was brought into the company by Elizabeth\\'s father, however, unless he married a Roffe, in this case, Elizabeth (since she was the only female left), would be unable to sit on the Board of Directors.  Williams was always kind to Liz (is it merely business or personal?) who grew up without a father\\'s presence in her life (just the comforts of his money).  Liz felt, even though she harbored strong feelings for Rhys, she could not afford to trust him or anyone until she uncovered the person out to destroy all that Samuel Roffe had built.  Each cousin has their own issues; Anna Roffe\\'s husband is out to destroy their children, Ivo Palazzi is leading a double life with two families, Charles is being lead around by Helene as a boy toy, Sir Alec has married Vivian, a wild, crazy party girl and Rhys has worked long and hard his adult life for Sam without the benefit of even a share of stock in the multimillion dollar business.  Each one has their own agenda for forcing first Sam and now Elizabeth to have the company go public and thereby attaining the financial means to destroy the \"fly in the ointment\" of their respective lives.  I could not put this book down until the last page was turned.  Sheldon is the \"master of storytelling.\"','And to me, there\\'s a big difference between the two.This is one of my favorite books ever. I once owned a hard copy, and it broke my heart when I lost it. This is not your run-of-the-mill bodice rippers; this is actually a historically correct, realistic, and totally fascinating story. Ingram takes you right into the details and politics of what life was like for the real people, not the perfumed toadies in court. The times were perilous and things could (and did!) change in the blink of an eye.Julitta is one of the strongest fictional heroines I\\'ve read, and I love how the relationship between her and Red Adam develops. They\\'re not perfect people, but they are honorable and they are perfect for each other. Even if Julitta doesn\\'t believe it for quite a while -- maybe because she doesn\\'t. This is not a hot, lustful romp; it\\'s a love story set in a dangerous historical time, and it\\'s really the best \"historical romance\" I\\'ve ever read.',\"First the one negative - the story they claimed hadn't been published in decades has in fact been published, but with a few changes (different detective mostly) so it's not a story you will never have read before.Otherwise this is a great collection.  It's wonderful to have all of the stories in one place.\",\"I came to The Liveship Trilogy from the Farseer and Tawny Man trilogies. This is actually a sidestep between those two that takes place in the same world but in another region. Only one character from the other two trilogies is involved in this story yet all of it weaves together to form a 9 book series. If I had not had the luxury of choosing to skip from Farseer to Tawny Man in order to stay with Fitz Chivalry I would have read everything in sequence......which I now see is the best way though not essential. Hobb has skillfully written the trilogies so that you need not venture to the Liveship series in order to maintain continuity. Having initially skipped to Tawny Man I did not feel anything was missing. Enough information was provided to fill any potential gaps. However, this is not to suggest that anything in the Liveship trilogy is not worth reading. This series stands on its own as well as fits together with the other two. It is an emotionally gripping tale full of characters you will learn to love. Fortunately this one ends leaving room to continue in a future story. Where Tawny picks up and ends does not define where Liveship could go. I do not regret the order I read them in because I needed to stay with Fitz Chivalry's story at the time. The design of each tolerates such a sequence. But Ideally, do yourself a favor and read the sequence in order from Farseer to Liveship to Tawny Man so you can gain the most from this wonderful tale.\",'One of the classics that everyone should read. It is also one of the most profound books that is this short.'...]"

              "During the Great Depression, Robert's younger brother Matthew disappears from a small dusty prairie community in Saskatchewan, after Robert refuses to walk into town with him. Plagued with guilt, Robert finds himself at first drawn to the new stranger in town, Abram Harsich, who claims he can help the town's dry spell by building a \"rainmill.\" However, as the rest of the townspeople fall under Abram's spell, Robert and his Uncle Alden seem to be the only ones who think that Abram isn't who he says he is. More children start to disappear and eventually Robert starts to piece together the mystery. The premise of the book was interesting, but all the supernatural elements were kind of strange.

              "I'd happily give every Aubrey-Maturin novel five stars, but I've got to differentiate somehow. This one is interesting, because the first three novels, while having relatively independent story arcs, share a strong consistency of style, characterization, and timing. The Mauritius Command seems a bit of an experiment for O'Brian.No longer do we have the so very youthful, deeply flawed but energetically driven Aubrey and Maturin. There seems to me some inconsistency in timeline, age, etc. in the cursory-to-the-point-of-irrelevance intro in which we see the Aubrey the semi-retired and ineffective family man whose wife is ready to get him out of the house.The rest of the story is in fairly classic style, but a little too focused on reenacting the historical details of an extensive and well-documented naval campaign to the detriment of the highly charged, personal stories like the relationship triangle that led to the dramatic duel in &#34;HMS Surprise.&#34;So, the book is a bit of an oddball when compared to the strong flow of narrative and style in the novels before and after, as if O'Brian just didn't quite know where he was going, but picked it up again in Vol. 5. Don't get me wrong though, it is good, and not to be missed.    1\n",

              "This was a lovely book - the kind that draws you in and you find it impossible to put down. Well written with beautifully drawn characters, lots of action, and a terrific romantic love story.Enemies aren't supposed to fall in love. The chasm between a Royalist and a Puritan during England's civil war is nearly impossible to overcome - yet Justin and Abby do just that. Their path isn't easy or quick, but it is a wonderful story to read. I simply love Stella Riley's writings, and I'm just delighted to have stumbled upon them.The military setting of this book - a troop of Royalists holding a castle under siege in hostile territory - was reminiscent of Carla Kelly's books in that both authors convey the desperation and heartaches caused by war, but do it in a heartwarming style that is hopeful, not depressing. They both excel in creating believable romances that occur despite the hardships of war and if you like Kelly, you'll like Riley.I highly recommend this book - and anything Stella Riley has written.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1\n",

Martin kills all I care about. I honk I skipped every other word to try to see what was going to happen!','Controversy has swirled around Ernest Hemingway\\'s masterpiece since the day it was published. \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize in 1941 and the Pulitzer committee agreed unanimously to name the book as the winner of the fiction category. Board president Nicholas Murray Butler, however, overruled the committee on the grounds that he felt the book to be profane and offensive. No award in the fiction category was given that year. The Pulitzer committee, sans Butler, did go on to award Hemingway in 1953 for \"The Old Man and the Sea.\" Butler has since been widely criticized for his partisan politics and racial beliefs during his 43 year stint as president of Columbia University. Hemingway also won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1954.\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" is Ernest Hemingway\\'s seminal novel of the Spanish Civil War. Beginning in 1937 Hemingway traveled to Spain to cover the war as a reporter. In the years before WWII, Spanish Republicans, backing the established Spanish Republic fought the fascist Nationalist forces of General Francisco Franco. The Republicans received backing from the Soviet Union and various organizations of the Marxist movement, among others. The rising forces of Nazi Germany and Italy backed Franco. The fascists under Franco won. Franco established a dictatorship and then went on to rule Spain with an iron hand until his death in 1975.It is easy to get hung up on all the politics involved in this book - who is backing which side, etc. Remember the time frame of the book (pre-WWII) and know that the story is essentially human. It is about ideals, loyalty, love, sacrifice, and honor in the face of loss and death. Robert Jordan is an American who joins the guerrillas fighting on the side of the republic as a dynamiter. Jordan\\'s goal is to blow a key bridge right after a Republican attack starts against the Fascists. He meets up with the anti-Fascist cell in the area, which is headquartered in a well-hidden cave. Pilar is the wife of Pablo, who ostensibly is in charge, but Pilar runs the show. Pablo is tired, burned out, and dangerous to the cause after years of war and atrocities committed on both sides, and Pilar takes the reins. While coordinating the attack with the cell Robert Jordan meets and falls in love with Maria, a young woman adopted by the cell after her family is decimated by the fascists and she is raped by their soldiers. Much like the principal characters in \"A Farewell to Arms,\" the wartime romance is accelerated and Jordan undergoes a transformation due to his love for Maria. He begins to question his role in an increasingly futile conflict. He spiritually takes Maria for his wife with hopes and dreams for the future. When it becomes evident that the guerrilla attack will be doomed, Jordan must decide between escaping with Maria or staying true to his ideals and do his duty with honor in the face of impending disaster. The entire story takes place in four days.I really liked \"For Whom the Bell Tolls.\" It gets beyond the politics and the ideologies and more into the nature of war, showing that there is good and bad on both sides of any conflict. Hemingway points out that the best soldiers don\\'t necessarily win a war - the ones with the biggest weapons do. \"To make war all you need is intelligence. But to win you need talent and material.\" Other memorable gems from the text include, \"Nothing is done to oneself that one does not accept,\" and \"If you stop complaining and asking for what you never will get, you will have a good life. A good life is not measured by any biblical span.\" The apt title itself comes from the John Donne quote, \"...And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; It tolls for thee.\" Thus is the nature of any conflict, regardless of the politics involved.  One reason Jordan, an American, is fighting in Spain is because he is concerned with the rise of bigotry and fascism in his own country. This belief is made all the more ironic by the treatment of the book by the Pulitzer committee and Nicholas Murray Butler in 1941, on the very eve of America\\'s entry into WWII against Nazi Germany.Do not be intimidated by \"For Whom the Bell Tolls.\" On the surface it reads like a great adventure story with compelling characters. It is so much more than that, however. As with the very best of novels, its themes and messages are truly timeless, ringing true during the Spanish Civil War, WWII, Vietnam, and today. This is an excellent book, and I recommend it very highly.',\"I wondered at a file size of 362 kb and length of 8 pages.  A mass market paperback costing $12.88 for 8 pages??  Sosemthing's not right here.  Especially with all those awards.  I rarely purchase a book of less than 10 pages - even for free but I took a chance and bought the book.  Page 8 (on my Kindle) goes from location 93 to 1873.  Page 8 just never ends.  I'm glad I took the chance.I'm reading it now so can't give a proper review but I wanted to let people know that this is more than 6 pages long.  So far I'm enjoying the story.\",'I\\'m currently a bit hooked on classic mysteries (blame it on PBS\\'s \\'Mystery\\' series), and looking through my horde of books, I found Agatha Christie\\'s \"Third Girl\", a 1966 work featuring Christie\\'s famed Hercule Poirot. What is immediately striking is the setting of the novel; mod 1966 England, an odd place for Poirot who is, at least on TV, ususally associated with the 1930s and \\'40s. Also unexpected is Christie\\'s kind narrative which is an impressive unbiased view of the era\\'s youth drug culture; she speaks of junkiedom as if it were a passing teen fad, as serious or frivolous as any other era\\'a hang-ups. In \"Third Girl\", a young girl arrives in Poirot\\'s office and announces she may have committed a murder. She disappears before Poirot can find out anything else regarding her bizarre statement and he spends the bulk of the novel searching for her and deciphering what she meant. Although there are a series of mini-who done its throughout the book, the question really is, \"Say what?\" I suspect hard core fans of the genre will confidentally figure this mystery out before it\\'s conclusion, but I was over taxed with clues, and the resolution and the path leading up to it are a bit hokey, and reliant on extremely unlikely coincidences, facts and answers seem to fall at our detective\\'s feet, and even though the final answer is like a product in an exquisite math equation, it is still a trick question. That\\'s ok though, it\\'s not so much the mystery which attracts me to the genre, particularly Christie\\'s work; it\\'s her heroes, their mannerisms and idiosyncracies, their minds, their friends, their homes and homes away from home, like Miss Marple reading Dashiel Hammett over a cup of tea when a gunshot is heard, or Hercule Poirot delving into a chocolate layered desert while paging through an art book on French paintings, when suddenly it occurs to him who the killer must be, and he calls everybody into the room to name the murderer. I like answers in a real world of little resolve.',\"found parts tedious and skipped hundreds of pages, but read the beginning and though skipped many pages, read through to where Pam is murdered and the hero is released from hospital; then read abit after that, then skipped to the end. what I like about it is it tells the story of a young sex slave who temporarily escapes her slavers, finds refuge and hope, only to be murdered by them in the end. I like that the story tells a believable fictionalized account of what happens to so many young people forced into prostitution and describes the hell of their life, detailing how they are victimized and controlled. to me, the hero is dumb and his character inconsistently written. dumb because the young woman tells him what she's been through and where, but he drives to that part of town anyway, confident he can protect himself and her, not asking himself what could happen if he were unable to handle the situation, though he knows nothing about the drug world or how it operates. I found his over confidence annoying, especially considering the slave pays with her life. I thought his character inconsistently written because the author writes how careful and cautious a sailor he is, then has him cockily cruise a drug infested neighborhood, which leads to the heroine's torture and murder. 2 and 1/2 stars for the believable story of the slave.\",'I love all of the Alex Cross novels. They hold your attention with every page. I am working on acquiring the entire series. Definitely books I can read over and over.','intriguing and it keeps on your toes till the end. Interesting when it describe the submarine and tactics. Dr. Carpenter character is very special and his relations with members of the crew are a plus to the story',\"I realized they are just reselling the same bloated mess that was WoT in a different format, hyperextended for maximum cash. This isn't art folks. If you think it is I am here to tell you that you have been duped. Yeah, Robert Jordan could have been the new Tolkien. Instead he died with people thinking he was a shill. The same is going to be said here like it or not.Martin has lost the ability to write a decent story over the two decades I guess it takes to complete what, more than likely in the author's original plans, was a proper 3 or 4 book series in total. DoD is nothing more than a plodding mid-tier adventure that leaves more loose ends than it solves. Sound familiar?I bet WoT could have made a 10 book series if Jordan was an actual artist with conviction. I'm tempted to say WoT had the best original plans, a midway point between Tolkien and Martin, but RJ really flew the coop. Martin hasn't quite arrived in nutterville but he might as well be a couple minutes from town at this point.This is what happens, folks: your original, and more than probably excellent, plan for the trilogy (LOL) is force fed a bunch of 'corporate corn' for weeks. Hell, years even.... and then the trilogy simply can't cover the world building and character killing. Well, oh well right? OH NO. Now we are writing seriously and seriousness demands thousands of pages that don't have any connection to the original story but to prolong it. And then the side stories become part of the main story. And then.... barf.The printers start printing money....My advice is: don't ever get into these 'novels'. Ever. They are just another crack addiction that goes awry. I honestly don't even care that I have never finished this or the Wheel of Time. I probably will not ever pick them up again. That is exactly how much these authors have erased my memory of the good times I used to have with them. Horrible.I am also here to tell exactly how these writers function. They are not great writers, for they fear the ending of their 'baby'. Great writers continue on through their best work and keep doing other things, they keep innovating on their own style or they stop writing. Well, he may have stopped writing for a bit I don't really know, but what I do know is that Martin is now in full on 'Soap Opera' mode just like Jordan turned to around book 6 of WoT. This means he is simply wanking away whatever comes to mind at this point while following a loose structure. And while Jordan's work got him through book 6, some say to book 9, before people started to question what was going on, Martin has the detractors firmly in tow after Book 4. That isn't a good sign.And I HIGHLY doubt Martin keeps as much information about storylines as Jordan did.... meaning this will be an even bigger mess than WoT unless they can get a really good editor in here. For those that do enjoy this stuff great. No problem have a good time. But after being burned by WoT MAJORLY, I don't step into these time sinks lightly. And this one has way too many parallels to WoT. Not only that, he is running out of decent characters to kill and his world building is still second tier behind Jordan and Tolkien. I like his dialogue more often than not but I cannot support these guys who just don't have the vision required to complete their sagas in a proper timeframe WITHOUT all the egregious fat and gristle.\"...]"
